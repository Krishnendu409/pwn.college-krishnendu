# The Root 
*Module:* Pondering Paths (pwn.college)  
**Date:** 2025-09-22

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0wjASxTvcg3yNTMcFDnmB_2MUPP.QX4cTO0wSN0EzNzEzW}`

## How I solved it
The challenge description mentioned that a binary called `pwn` was placed in the root directory `/`. Since the level was about absolute paths, I realized the way to run it was to type `/pwn`. As soon as I did that, the flag was printed.

## Why this works
Absolute paths always start with `/`, which is the filesystem root. By typing `/pwn`, the shell looks exactly in `/` and runs the binary there, without relying on the current directory or PATH.

## What I learned
I learned the difference between absolute and relative paths. Writing `/pwn`, `./pwn`, or just `pwn` can mean completely different things depending on where I am in the filesystem.

# Program and absolute paths
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wovuX0qJcN-Ay7TQT78kErT36iU.QX1QTN0wSN0EzNzEzW}`

## How I solved it
This challenge reinforced the concept of absolute paths. The description mentioned a program placed somewhere in `/challenge`. I realized that to run it, I just needed to type the full path from root. Once I entered `/challenge/run` at the prompt, the flag appeared instantly. It was straightforward because the level focused on understanding absolute paths.

## Why this works
An absolute path begins with `/` and points directly to a file or directory from the root. Using `/challenge/run` makes sure the shell executes exactly that binary, without depending on the current working directory or PATH.

## What I learned
I learned to distinguish between absolute and relative paths and why absolute paths are useful for running programs reliably. It also showed me that just knowing the program name isn’t enough if you aren’t in the right location or if it isn’t in PATH.
