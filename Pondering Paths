# The Root (Pondering Paths)
*Module:* Pondering Paths (pwn.college)  
**Date:** 2025-09-22

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0wjASxTvcg3yNTMcFDnmB_2MUPP.QX4cTO0wSN0EzNzEzW}`

## How I solved it
The challenge description mentioned that a binary called `pwn` was placed in the root directory `/`. Since the level was about absolute paths, I realized the way to run it was to type `/pwn`. As soon as I did that, the flag was printed.

## Why this works
Absolute paths always start with `/`, which is the filesystem root. By typing `/pwn`, the shell looks exactly in `/` and runs the binary there, without relying on the current directory or PATH.

## What I learned
I learned the difference between absolute and relative paths. Writing `/pwn`, `./pwn`, or just `pwn` can mean completely different things depending on where I am in the filesystem.

## References
Did not use any references for this challenge.
